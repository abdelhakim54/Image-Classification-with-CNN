# Image-Classification-with-CNN

In this repo we solve a multi-class image classification problem using CNN.
the problem consist of classifying clothes into 10 categories (t-shirt, shirt, skirt, dress, ...)


## Dataset

the dataset used is available [in this github repo](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small)

to clone it use the following command :
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small.git
```
If youâ€™re doing it in AWS SageMaker, you can execute this command in a cell of the notebook, just add "!" before the command.
